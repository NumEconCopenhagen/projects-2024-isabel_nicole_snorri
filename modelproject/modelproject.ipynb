    "The Ricardian model of trade is a straightforward framework that elucidates the benefits of trade between countries. It demonstrates how two nations can both gain from trade, even if one nation is less efficient than the other in producing all goods. This mutual benefit arises because each country specializes in producing goods for which it has a relative productivity advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key assumptions of the model are as follows: There are only two nations and two different goods. Labor is the only factor of production, and full employment is assumed. There is perfect mobility of labor within each country, but not between countries. The model assumes constant returns to scale, meaning each unit of labor input consistently results in a constant amount of output. Additionally, there are no transportation costs, and the technology of production differs between the countries, resulting in different productivity levels for each good.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model simplifies the real world, by consisting two nations producing two diferent goods. In the model we have two nations (here \"nation 1\" and \"nation 2\") and two goods (here \"meat\" and \"potatos\")\n",
