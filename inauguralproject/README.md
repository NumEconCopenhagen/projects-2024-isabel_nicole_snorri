# Inaugural project
In this project, we analyse the exchange economy with 2 consumers, A & B, with two goods, x1 & x2.
    - we define allocation as x1A, x2A, x1B, x2B
Given the consumers' utility functions, endowment and demand, we solve for aspects such as the equilibrium price, allocation and distribution under different circumstances. 

We have provided the python code used, along with a brief explanation of a thinking process to answer the questions. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
