# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Cournot Model** and investigates the Counot model under different contexts. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) and also the [modelproject.py]. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
