# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **CORRELATIONS: POWERFUL OR MEANINGLESS?** and is about how correlations can be both powerfull and tricky, through the correlation analysis of two pairs of variables.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb) and also [DataProject.py].

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. chicken-meat-production.xlsx (*Our World in Data*) 
1. gdp-per-capita-maddison.xlsx (*Our World in Data*)
3. ict-adoption-per-100-people.xlsx (*Our World in Data*)
4. life-expectancy.xlsx (*Our World in Data*)

**Dependencies:**  Standard Anaconda Python 3 installation.
