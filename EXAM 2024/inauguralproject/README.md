# Inaugural project
In this project, we analyse the exchange economy with 2 consumers, A & B, with two goods, x1 & x2.

Given the consumers' utility functions, endowment and demand, we solve for aspects such as the equilibrium price, allocation and distribution under different circumstances.

We solve a set of 8 questions, using python code.  We provide an initial general economical explanation on how to solve each question. Whitin the code there are also small notes to explain each piece of code written.  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. The project also refers to a py file [ExchangeEconomy.py] for coding neatness and simplification.
